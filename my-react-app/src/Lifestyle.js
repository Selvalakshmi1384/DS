    The Lifestyle page on my portfolio website offers a glimpse into
     my personal preferences, values, and experiences that shape my
      way of living. It's a space where I share my passions and the
       things that bring joy and fulfillment to my life. From wellness
        and self-care to travel and exploration, I delve into various
         aspects of my lifestyle. I believe in nurturing a holistic 
         sense of well-being, and I discuss practices such as meditation, 
         yoga, and exercise that contribute to my overall wellness.
